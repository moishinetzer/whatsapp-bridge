## v0.1.0 — 2026-09-09

First release: the WhatsApp ↔ Intro bridge as a local daemon on a dedicated number.

- Link a dedicated number by QR or pairing code; the session persists on disk (mode 0700) and survives restarts.
- Inbound DMs (groups opt-in) become versioned `MessageReceived` events; echoes, status and protocol noise are filtered.
- Every accepted message gets a 👀 reaction within seconds; it is removed once the reply for its turn is sent.
- Messages from one chat within `BRIDGE_BATCH_WINDOW` form one turn; newer messages interrupt an in-flight turn (`TurnSuperseded`) and a new turn carries everything.
- Three responders: `manual` (Intro answers via `POST /turns/{id}/reply`), `http` (the bridge POSTs turns to `INTRO_HANDLER_URL`), `pong` (the harness).
- Local HTTP API (`/health`, `/status`, `/events` SSE with `?since=` replay, `/chats/...` send/react/unreact/typing, `/turns` list/get/reply) with OpenAPI at `/openapi.json` and docs at `/docs`.
- `needs_relink` detection on logout/ban with the stale session moved aside; automatic reconnect with jittered backoff otherwise.
- CLI: `link`, `run`, `harness`, `health`, `send`, `react`, `unreact`, `turns`, `reply`, `unlink`.
- Event schema version 1.
